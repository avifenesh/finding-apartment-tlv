IMPORTANT: Your credentials have been removed from the code and git history.

The authentication now uses hashed values. Your original credentials were:
- Email: aviarchi1994@gmail.com  
- Password: Af!@#$56789

These still work, but are no longer visible in the code.

To update credentials in the future:
1. Generate SHA-256 hashes of new email and password
2. Update the hash values in frontend/login.html

Keep this file LOCAL ONLY - do not commit to git!
